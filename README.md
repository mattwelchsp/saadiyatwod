# SaadiyatWOD

A complete **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS** starter for a daily workout dashboard.

## Scaffold status

The codebase is already written to this repository (committed in git history) and includes the required root files:

- `package.json`
- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/layout.tsx`
- `app/globals.css`
- TypeScript, Tailwind, PostCSS, and ESLint configuration

## Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- ESLint (Next.js config)

## Project setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open <http://localhost:3000>.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Start local development server.
- `npm run build` – Create production build.
- `npm run start` – Start production server.
- `npm run lint` – Run ESLint.
- `npm run typecheck` – Run TypeScript checks.

## Notes for restricted environments

If `npm install` fails due to registry/network policy errors (like `403`), the source code is still complete and can be pushed/committed. Run setup commands in an environment with registry access.
