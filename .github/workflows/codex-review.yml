            Review this pull request and post a PR comment.

            Your review must explicitly answer each item:
            1) Any env-var fallback behavior that could mask prod misconfig?
            2) Did app/layout.tsx become a client component or force client rendering?
            3) Confirm routes remain /, /monthly, /login.
            4) Bottom nav hidden on /login and safe-area/padding prevents overlap.
            5) Any risky refactors or production-impacting changes?
            6) Recommend merge: YES/NO with rationale.
